	* added README, INSTALL, NEWS and COPYING
	* remove superfluous usbprog/usbprog.cc file (which was only there for
	  testing)
	* always print the current update device (*) in the "devices" command,
	  not only if there are more than 1 update devices
	* run DeviceManager::discoverUpdateDevices() in the "devices" command
	  instead of printing an error message when zero update devices are
	  currently registered
