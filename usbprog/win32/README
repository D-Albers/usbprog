To comple USBprog on Win32, perform following steps:

  1. Download Devcpp 5

  2. Install the libxml, iconv and libcurl option packs.

  3. Download libusb (e.g. libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.1.tar.gz).

  4. Extract usbprog to some directory that doesn't contain spaces (so your
     “home directory” is the wrong place on Windows).

  5. Extract the libusb tarball to win32/ directory of usbprog. Rename the
     libusb-win32-device-bin-0.1.12.1 directory to libusb-win32 (you should have
     win32/libusb-win32/include now).

  6. Open the win32/libusbprog.dev in Devcpp and compile it with Ctrl+F9.
     Then open the win32/usbprog.dev and compile with Ctrl+F9 also.

  7. Copy libcurl.dll, libiconv-2.dll, libxml2.dll and zlib1.dll to the win32
     directory.

  8. Execute usbprog.exe.
